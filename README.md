This extension provides:

- An implementation of the Domain Sheet for MCDM's [Kingdom's & Warfare](https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/collections/kingdoms-warfare).
- A Unit Card Creator inspired by the rules in MCDM's [Strongholds & Followers](https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/products/strongholds-followers-pdf).
    - Check out [Freddy's Unit Card Creator](https://freddybushboy.github.io/unit-cards/) for a standalone version. 
- Rules for mass combat in DnD 5E based on MCDM's Strongholds & Followers, but combined with MCDM's Kingdom's & Warfare, adapted for a combat on a 5 ft. grid.
    - The rules can be found in the /docs/ directory in this repository

## Game Design Notes

Personally, I enjoy the rules of warfare at the end of Stronghold & Followers, they are simple, but I'd rather play with a grid.

When Kingdom & Warfare came out, it had a grid, but it brought a lot of complexity with it... But combining both systems you get the ultimate warfare experience: the ease of <i>Stronghold</i> with the tactical depth of <i>Kingdom</i>.
